Beneficiaries having BMI >30 together with smoking form a synergistic effect on charge.

smoking, age and obesity are the factors that contribute the most in the calculation of insurance costs.

The RMSE would suggest that, on average, predictions varied from observed values by an absolute measure of $5756.
